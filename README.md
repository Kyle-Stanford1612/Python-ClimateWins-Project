# Python-ClimateWins-Project
This repository contains my Python code for a student project I completed when studying with CareerFoundry. In this project, I used Python to create and train machine learning models to predict weather patterns for a fictional company called ClimateWins. Their are two main presentations as this project was split over two parts. The first presentation addresses if machine learning models could be effectively used to make predictions regarding the impacts of climate change, and future steps to ensure these models' success. The final presentation details "thought experiments" of how different machine learning models could be used to identify unusual weather patterns, forecast weather patterns, and identify regions across Europe that would be safe from catastrophic weather changes. Ultimately, this project is a documentation of my initial learnings about Machine Learning.

## Project Context:

ClimateWins is a European nonprofit organisation interested in using machine learning to help predict the consequences of climate change around Europe and, potentially, the world. Their first phase is to train machine learning models to predict picnic suitability, using existing data, and use the performance of different machine learning models to inform how machine learning can be used in their overall strategy.

## Key Question and Objectives:

● How is machine learning used? Is it applicable to weather data?

● ClimateWins has heard of ethical concerns surrounding machine learning and AI. Are there any concerns specific to this project?

● Can machine learning be used to predict whether weather conditions will be favorable on a certain day? (If so, it could also be possible to predict danger.)

## Data and Tools Used
2 datasets were used for this project.

  **1.** European weather data from 18 weather stations between 1960 and 2022. Collected by the [European Climate Assessment & Data Set Project.](https://www.ecad.eu/)
  
  **2.** Categorised weather answers - for training different machine learning models.

**Note:** The European weather data exists in this repo as an original version, cleaned version, and other versions for use in various machine learning algorithms with different data requirements.

## Folders
Project files are stored using the following folder structure:

● *01 Project Management*: Contains project briefs for part 1 and 2.

● *02 Data*: Would normally contain the datasets listed above (including the European weather data in a scaled and unscaled formatted). However, the scaled data can't be uploaded due to size restraints and will thus be linked to here:

● *03 Scripts*: Contains Jupyter notebooks with all relevant code used throughout the project.

● *04 Analysis*: Contains 3 screenshots of graphed cost functions and parameters using gradient descent optimisation. This highlights the effect of using different total iterations and starting parameters. Also contains screenshots of decision trees from random forest models, as well as dendrograms from hierarchical clustering models.

● *05 Sent to Client*: Contains 2 presentations for ClimateWins. Both presentation includes project results and recommendations to inform ClimateWins strategy moving forward.

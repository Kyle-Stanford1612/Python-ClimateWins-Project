# Python-ClimateWins-Project
This repository contains my Python code for a student project I completed when studying with CareerFoundry. In this project, I used Python to clean large data sets, merge data sets, run descriptive analyses, create columns, and visualise the data to answer business questions for an online grocery business Instacart.

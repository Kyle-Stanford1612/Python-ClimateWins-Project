# Python-ClimateWins-Project
This repository contains my Python code for a student project I completed when studying with CareerFoundry. In this project, I used Python to create and train machine learning models to predict weather patterns for a fictional company called ClimateWins. The final presentation addresses if machine learning models could be effectively used to make predictions regarding the impacts of climate change, and future steps to ensure these models' success.

## Project Context:
![Uploading image.png…]()



ClimateWins is a European nonprofit organisation interested in using machine learning to help predict the consequences of climate change around Europe and, potentially, the world. Their first phase is to train machine learning models to predict picnic suitability, using existing data, and use the performance of different machine learning models to inform how machine learning can be used in their overall strategy.

## Key Question and Objectives:

● How is machine learning used? Is it applicable to weather data?

● ClimateWins has heard of ethical concerns surrounding machine learning and AI. Are there any concerns specific to this project?

● Can machine learning be used to predict whether weather conditions will be favorable on a certain day? (If so, it could also be possible to predict danger.)

## Data and Tools Used
2 datasets were used for this project.

  **1.** European weather data from 18 weather stations between 1960 and 2022. Collected by the European Climate Assessment & Data Set Project.
  
  **2.** Categorised weather answers - for training different machine learning models.

## Folders
Project files are stored using the following folder structure:

● *01 Project Management*: Contains project brief.

● *02 Data*: Contains the datasets listed above (including the European weather data in a scaled and unscaled formatted)

● *03 Scripts*: Contains Jupyter notebooks with all relevant code used throughout the project.

● *04 Analysis*: Contains 3 screenshots of graphed cost functions and parameters using gradient descent optimisation. This highlights the effect of using different total iterations and starting parameters

● *05 Sent to Client*: Contains the final presentation for ClimateWins. The presentation includes project results and recommendations to inform ClimateWins strategy moving forward.

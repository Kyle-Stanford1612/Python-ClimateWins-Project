# Python-ClimateWins-Project
This repository contains my Python code for a student project I completed when studying with CareerFoundry. In this project, I used Python to create and train machine learning models to predict weather patterns for a fictional company called ClimateWins. The final presentation addresses if machine learning models could be effectively used to make predictions regarding the impacts of climate change, and future steps to ensure these models success.
